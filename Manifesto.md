# Project Manifesto for the Self-Contained Image Information Extractor

1. **Total Self-Containment:** The system will operate entirely offline, including all necessary data, models, and binaries within the download package. There will be no external calls or dependencies.

2. **Uncompromising Neutrality:** The program will strictly report results without censorship or value judgments, maintaining complete neutrality regardless of the content.

3. **Broad CPU Compatibility:** Designed for diverse hardware, the program will operate efficiently on a wide array of CPUs, running seamlessly in the background without real-time constraints. Multiple versions will cater to varying hardware capabilities.

4. **Configurable Precision:** With customizable settings and sensible defaults, users will have control over the output, ensuring consistency in results.

5. **Deterministic Testing:** Each tool will undergo extensive, deterministic testing with a comprehensive library of images, ensuring reliability and consistency without randomness or failure.

6. **Extensive File Type and Tool Integration:** The program must embrace a wide array of file types and tools, ensuring it can handle virtually any data extraction need. Every tool that generates data should be considered for integration, maximizing versatility and effectiveness.

7. **Extensive Documentation:** Provide detailed documentation covering setup, troubleshooting, and output, including type-checking for multiple languages.

8. **Simplicity:** Ensure the program is user-friendly, aiming for a one-click solution without complicated setup processes or the need for API keys.

9. **Seamless and Flexible Integration:** The program should be built with a strong focus on flexibility and openness, allowing for seamless integration into other projects. Usability and modularity must be core values, making it adaptable and versatile.

10. **Use off-the-shelf tools:** The program should leverage existing tools and libraries wherever possible, avoiding reinventing the wheel and focusing on integration and optimization.
