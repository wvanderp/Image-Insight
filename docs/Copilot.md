Hello copilot, I have a few instructions that lets you work better with the repository.

To build the docker use `npm run build-docker`.

Then you can use `npm run run` to run the docker container on an image.

always use python3 for this codebase.

We will always be working in the docker container, so never install any packages on your local machine.
